## About Us ðŸ“š

Munus & Niktari is the research, design, and development (R&D&D) practice of Munus Shih and Nikki (Niktari) Makagiansar. In their practice, they recognize code as an agent for augmenting research, communication design, and artistic experiences in new and meaningful ways. They adopt open-source values in their process in pursuit of fostering transparent, equitable, and intentional collaboration.

Munus co-organizes with SpOnAcT!, a Taiwanese queer art and code collective, and co-hosted the 2023 Processing Community Day in Taiwan. Nikki co-organizes with SPICY, a collective that works in between art, justice, and cultural archival. Together, they teach interaction design and creative coding at Parsons School of Design and The Cooper Union, and contribute to open-source projects at the Processing Foundation.
