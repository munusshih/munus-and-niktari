## About Us ðŸ“š

Munus Shih (he/they) is a Hakka Taiwanese artist, creative technologist, and organizer who uses data and generative design to craft compelling stories and foster critical perspectives in code. Munus co-organized SpOnAcT!, a Taiwanese queer art and code collective, and co-hosted the 2023 Processing Community Day Taiwan.

Nikki (Niktari) Makagiansar (she/her) is a designer, coder, and educator. Central to her practice is exploring code as a design, art-making, and community-organizing tool. She co-founded SPICY, an arts organization for queer and trans people of color. Nikki has worked with studios such as Morcos Key and Pentagram, where she developed data-driven and algorithmic visual identities for arts and cultural organizations.

Previously, Munus and Nikki operated under the name Duty Free and explored the intersections of design, code, and solidarity economies. They also teach interactive design and creative coding classes at Parsons School of Design and Cooper Union, and contributed to open-source projects at the Processing Foundation.
